# Top 50 Spotify Songs of 2019 - Exploratory Data Analysis

**MOTIVATION**

As a musician, I'm always interested in what drives today's popular music. Since the music industry has experienced a massive paradigm shift towards streaming-based services over the last decade, a plethora of data are now available for all sorts of interesting analyses. I recognize that this dataset is tiny in scope (only 50 rows), but I chose it specifically for that reason, as a load-light way to practice, being a beginner in data science. I try to be careful not to draw any lofty conclusions given the virtually microscopic scale of this dataset. This is intended to be a very simple analysis for the purpose of getting the feel of what data scientists do.
